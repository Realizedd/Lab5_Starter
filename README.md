1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I would not unit test the message feature of an entire messaging application as it would require the the test to go through every single components of the application, which is not possible with just unit tests.


1) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

I would use a unit test to test "max message length" feature as we can test the individual filtering module to see if it works as expected.
